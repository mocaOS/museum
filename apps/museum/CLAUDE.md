## Project Overview

MOCA Library — a Next.js 16 app serving the Museum of Crypto Art galleries plus a
**public, anonymous** chat front-end for the Cortex RAG knowledge assistant
(upstream codename: `library-backend`).

This app was forked from `cortex-chat`, a multi-tenant suite. The multi-user layer
(accounts, superadmin, user groups, minted per-group/per-user keys, encrypted key
storage, admin console, document upload, server-side history) has been **stripped
out** — the Library is now a single-key, anonymous experience. If you see references
to auth/users/groups/admin anywhere, they are stale; there is no database.

**Key features:**
- Anonymous public Library — no login, no accounts
- Streaming SSE responses from backend (`/api/ask/stream`)
- Chat and Deep Research modes
- Collection-scoped search (default: all collections the read-only key can see)
- Source citations with modal viewer
- Graph context (entities/relationships), thinking steps
- i18n (EN/DE), locale set via env
- **Client-side chat history** in `localStorage` — persists per machine across days
- Auto-generated chat titles via LLM after the first response
- Branding (accent color, logo, title, locale) configured via env, exposed at `/api/config`
- Optional static `cortexAnalyticsTemplate` context block injected server-side into
  every backend request for consumption by agent skills

## How we talk to Cortex

One backend, one key. `src/lib/cortex.ts` exposes `getCortexUrl()` (`CORTEX_API_URL`)
and `getCortexKey()` (`CORTEX_API_KEY`, a single **read-only** key). The browser never
calls Cortex directly — all traffic goes through `/api/ask/stream` and
`/api/proxy/[...path]`, which inject `X-API-Key: <CORTEX_API_KEY>`. If the key is
unset, those routes return 503 ("Library not configured") and the galleries still work.

There is no key minting, no encryption-at-rest, no per-user/per-group scoping. The
Cortex backend filters reads by whatever the key can access.

## Chat history (client-side)

History lives entirely in the browser. `src/lib/chatHistory.ts` stores an array of
`ChatSession` under `localStorage["moca-library-chats"]` — same `listChats/getChat/
createChat/updateChatMessages/updateChatTitle/deleteChat` signatures as before, just
no network. `src/app/library/page.tsx` creates a session lazily on the first message,
persists on each settled turn, and the opaque `conversation_memory` blob rides along in
the session. Because it's `localStorage` (not `sessionStorage`), a visitor's chats
survive reloads and restarts until they clear browser storage.

## Cortex analytics

Optional static context block prepended to every backend request, server-side, for
backend agent skills to read.

- **Source:** `CORTEX_ANALYTICS_TEMPLATE` env var (`getAppSettings().cortexAnalyticsTemplate`).
  Empty default → no injection.
- **Injection:** `injectCortexAnalytics(bodyText, template)` in `src/lib/cortex-analytics.ts`
  prepends `{role:"user", content: template}` to `conversation_history` before the
  `/api/ask/stream` proxy forwards upstream. Fails open on malformed JSON.
- **Invisibility:** the block never reaches the browser (proxy mutates the body
  server-side only) and is never written to localStorage. Re-applied per request.
- Note: there are no users, so there is no per-user variable substitution — the
  template is injected verbatim.

## Collection Scoping (user-facing)

- Chat and Deep Research default to searching **all collections the key can read**.
  No `collection_id` is sent — the backend filters by key scope.
- Users can narrow to a single collection via the settings panel (gear icon).
- The scope indicator in `ChatInput` shows the resolved collection name or
  "Searching across all collections".

## Exhibitions & the 3D world builder

`/rooms` lists the museum's 3D rooms (Directus `rooms` collection, GLB models)
with a per-room viewer; `/rooms/world` is the **world builder** — an RTS-style
mode where visitors place rooms onto a shared ground plane, hang artworks from the
collection on wall slots, adjust each piece, and save named exhibits. All client-side,
no accounts. Code lives in `src/components/museum/three/`:

- **`WorldBuilder.tsx`** — the builder scene: goal-damped RTS camera (WASD/edge pan,
  Q/E rotate, wheel **zoom-to-cursor**, RMB orbit, MMB pan, double-click room to
  focus), room placement/dragging/rotation (right-click cancels placing, R/Shift+R
  rotate, C curates the selection), curate mode, keyboard map, cursor feedback.
- **`BuilderSidebar.tsx`** — the unified exhibition-management panel on the left
  (collapsible to an icon rail): **Build** (searchable room library + selected-room
  actions + clear), **Curate** (per-room fill progress, slot chips, active-slot
  scale/reset/remove, embedded artwork browser, auto-fill), **Exhibits** (saved
  exhibits + **Spawn to Hyperfy** primary CTA + file export). Slot clicks in 3D
  auto-reveal the Curate tab.
- **`ControlsHelp.tsx`** — bottom-right nav cluster (zoom in/out, reset view, help
  icon) plus the grouped controls reference that slides in on the right (H toggles).
- **`ArtworkPlane.tsx`** — one hung work: textured plane + matte frame, sized to the
  work's true aspect ratio (read from the loaded texture's pixels, falling back to
  catalog `ratio`). In curate mode supports drag-to-move along the wall plane and a
  corner-handle resize; both write a per-slot override `{dx, dy, scale}`.
- **`ArtworkPicker.tsx`** — exports `ArtworkBrowser`, the embeddable search/browse
  grid used by the sidebar's Curate tab (`/api/museum/artworks`,
  `/api/museum/collections`), scoped by collection, click to hang.
- **`ExhibitsPanel.tsx`** — save/load/update/delete named exhibits (embedded in the
  sidebar's Exhibits tab).
- **`SpawnHyperfyDialog.tsx`** — spawns the current exhibition into any
  self-hosted Hyperfy v2 world straight from the browser (world URL + admin
  key, persisted in `moca-hyperfy-target-v1`; per-room progress + post-spawn
  verification). The protocol/orchestration lives in
  `src/lib/museum/hyperfy/` — `protocol.ts` (minimal msgpackr wire client,
  pinned to Hyperfy v0.16.0), `room-script.ts` (generated per-room app script:
  `app.configure` refinement props + the embedded in-world slot editor),
  `spawn.ts` (idempotent spawn: deterministic ids from the layout's
  `exhibitionId`, blueprint version bumps on re-spawn, in-world arrangement
  preserved; uploads curated images into the world as content-addressed
  assets). **Layout translation:** the builder normalizes rooms onto 8-unit
  tiles, so exports carry per-room GLB measurements + the baked slot map
  (`footprint`/`groundOffset`/`slots`, lifted from `PlacedRoom` via
  `onMeasure`) and the spawners reproduce the layout by scaling each room to
  `tileMeters` (dialog "Room size", default 16 m) — artworks hang on baked
  anchors (required for un_MUSEUM `Auto_NNN` slots, which never exist as GLB
  nodes) and letterbox into their slot frames like the builder; generated
  scripts divide meter sizes by `rootScale`; legacy scale-1 entities are
  healed on re-spawn. **In-world slot editor:** with the room's "Slot
  editing" prop on, builders hold E at a work and nudge/resize it; the
  server validates rank, persists to world `storage.json` keyed by the
  deterministic entity id (survives restarts, rebuilds, re-spawns) and
  rebroadcasts (`moca:adjust` / `moca:adjust:init` app events).
  **Museum guide:** the dialog's guide toggle (default on) spawns an agentic
  VRM avatar with the exhibition — `spawn.ts` registers the exhibition
  context with the MOCA API (`POST /v1/guide/exhibitions`, the explicit
  opt-in moment where curation data reaches MOCA servers), uploads the
  chosen `.vrm` (catalog `public/avatars/avatars.json`, default
  `omnimorph-3321.vrm`), and spawns the generated `guide-script.ts` app:
  hold-E conversation panel, clickable suggested questions, free text via
  world chat, per-player private answers fetched server-side from
  `POST /v1/guide/ask` (exhibition context + Cortex + optional Art DeCC0
  persona via the dialog's "DeCC0 persona" token id, default 4209 =
  Tsahafi). The dialog's **Download guide app (.hyp)** button
  (`guide-hyp.ts` + `hyp.ts`) bundles the same guide as a drag-droppable
  Hyperfy app file — registers the context, then builds
  VRM+script into the engine's `.hyp` format; no world URL/key needed.
  **`GuideDialog.tsx`** (sidebar Exhibits tab → "Museum guide") is the
  dedicated agent launcher: persona picker (searchable Art DeCC0s live from
  api.decc0s.com, Soulweaver soul by chainId/contract/tokenId resolved
  server-side, or an uploaded SOUL.md baked into the app), avatar select,
  then `spawnGuide()` (guide-only idempotent spawn into the same world the
  rooms went to, with verification) or `.hyp` download.
  `protocol.ts`/`room-script.ts`/`guide-script.ts`/`hyp.ts` are **twins of
  `apps/hyperfy/lib/*.mjs`** (the CLI spawner) — keep them in sync.
- **`slots.ts`** — slot extraction from room GLBs. Authoring convention: room
  models carry `Slot_001…Slot_NNN` placeholder quads (material "Slot Placeholder");
  their transforms/bboxes define hang position, orientation, and frame size.
- **`auto-slots.ts`** — runtime fallback slot generation for models with **no**
  `Slot_NNN` placeholders (un_MUSEUMs not yet processed by the embed script —
  single-mesh sculptures whose slot *amount* lives onchain, synced into Directus
  `rooms.slots`, the source of truth). Deterministic seeded surface sampling
  (seed = room id): area-weighted candidates, floor/underside rejection,
  local-flatness scoring, greedy farthest-point pick with relaxing separation.
  Slots face outward along the surface normal (`RoomSlot.auto` skips the
  inward-to-room-center flip) so works hang on walls and lie on slanted limbs.
  **The canonical path is `apps/migration/embed-room-slots.ts`**, which bakes
  the same generated slots (1:1 algorithm port — keep them in sync) into an
  optimized GLB stored as `rooms.model_optimized` (draco + webp): the builder
  loads `model_optimized ?? model` (see `/rooms/world/page.tsx`), while the HQ
  `model` stays untouched for the `/rooms/[id]` viewer. Embedded slots also make
  Hyperfy exports work for un_MUSEUMs (the spawner resolves `Slot_NNN` nodes in
  the GLB it uploads).
- **`world-storage.ts`** — localStorage persistence. Working layout under
  `moca-world-layout-v1` (payload is **v2**: placements + assignments + slot
  overrides + `exhibitionId`, the stable identity Hyperfy spawns key their
  deterministic ids on; v1 payloads migrate on load). Named exhibits under
  `moca-world-exhibits-v1`. Same localStorage-only convention as chat history.
- **`RoomStage.tsx` / `RoomDetail.tsx`** — the ultra-HQ single-room viewer behind
  `/rooms/[id]` (replaced the old `Room3DViewer` lightbox): auto-framing
  + cinematic dolly-in, emissive/neon handling, radius-scaled key-light shadows,
  blurred MeshReflectorMaterial floor + baked ContactShadows, MSAA HalfFloat
  composer (UnrealBloom threshold 1.0 + vignette), PerformanceMonitor-driven
  adaptive DPR, poster/progress veil, ←/→ keyboard walk with wrap-around and
  idle-time GLB preload of the neighbouring rooms.
- **`RoomsBrowser.tsx`** — the searchable rooms grid on `/rooms`
  (client-side search over title/architect/series + architect filter chips); each
  card links to its detail page.

**Texture loading (don't regress this).** Artwork textures load through the
same-origin route **`/api/museum/texture?src=…&w=…`**, never directly from media
hosts: `THREE.TextureLoader` needs CORS on *every* redirect hop, and the
transform-in proxy 302s anything it can't transform back to origin hosts that
mostly don't send CORS (plain `<img>` thumbnails are unaffected — which is why the
picker can work while GL textures fail). The route fetches transform-in server-side
(WebP resize + dead-URL revival) with a direct-origin fallback, blocks SSRF
targets, and caches hard. Motion-only works (no still poster) hang as live
`THREE.VideoTexture`s — muted, looped mp4 via transform-in (`artworkVideoUrl`).
Related gotcha: any r3f material that carries a `map` must set `color="#ffffff"`
explicitly — conditional JSX branches reconcile the same material instance and a
stale dark `color` multiplies the texture to black.

**Square-crop media (original-vs-CDN).** OpenSea's conversion CDN
(`i2c.seadn.io`) serves ≤500px variants that are frequently square-CROPPED, and
the historical `nfts.media_info` blobs were probed from them — so both stored
URLs and stored dimensions can describe a crop, not the artwork.
`preferOriginalStill()` in `src/lib/museum/media.ts` swaps those stills for
`response_opensea.original_image_url` at render time and refuses to trust
square conversion-CDN dimensions for aspect ratios (`trustedDims`). The
permanent data fix is `apps/migration/fix-square-media-info.ts`, which
re-probes `media_info` from the original file (dry-run by default; `--write`
needs `DIRECTUS_API_KEY`).

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16.1.7 (Turbopack, `output: "standalone"`)
- React 19.2.4, TypeScript 5.9.3
- Tailwind CSS 4.2.1, react-markdown 10.1.0 + remark-gfm
- `zod` for route validation
- No database, no auth libs — chat state is `localStorage`, config is env
- Dark-first design system — see **Design system** below. Canonical OKLCh tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`; the legacy hex var names (`--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`, `--bg-tertiary`, `--border`, `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--accent`) are kept as aliases over the MOCA tokens.

Use CSS variables for all colors. No light mode. Styling is inline Tailwind + CSS vars.

## Design system

This product uses the **MOCA Library design system** (aka Claude Design). Before building or restyling any UI, read `.claude/skills/moca-library-design/README.md` — the canonical manifesto (visual foundations, voice, motion, iconography). `.claude/skills/moca-library-design/design-system.html` opens a live specimen index of every component. The skill is user-invocable as `/moca-library-design`.

**Non-negotiables:**

- Use MOCA tokens from `src/app/globals.css`. Never invent a new color. The palette is monochrome OKLCh + **one** chromatic accent.
- **One accent per screen.** Accent = primary CTA, active nav, live/running state, citation badges. Not for hover backgrounds, generic highlights, or decoration. The accent comes from the `ACCENT_COLOR` env var; default is `oklch(0.79 0.18 70.67)` (warm yellow-green) defined as `DEFAULT_ACCENT_COLOR` in `src/lib/settings.ts`.
- **Dark mode is primary.** `class="dark"` is set on `<html>` in `layout.tsx`. Test features in dark first.
- **Glass on chrome, not data.** Apply `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)` + translucent bg to sidebars, top nav, composer, modal shells. Content cards use opaque `var(--card)` with a 1px `var(--border)` hairline. Glass-on-glass is forbidden.
- **Type.** Inter Variable for UI, JetBrains Mono for IDs / metadata / timestamps / status chips. Display ≥24px uses `-0.015em` to `-0.02em` tracking; small uppercase labels use `+0.08em` tracking at `font-size: 10.5–11px`.
- **Icons.** Lucide outline only, 1.5–2px stroke, `currentColor`. Size ladder 14/16/20/24px. No emoji in product UI. No Unicode-as-icon — `<ArrowRight />`, not `→`, in icon slots (`→` is fine inline in prose).
- **Radius ladder.** `--radius` (8px) cards/buttons/inputs, `--radius-sm` (4px) inline chips, `--radius-xl` (16px) modals, full-pill for filter chips.
- **Motion.** Entrance 300–400ms `ease-out`; micro-interactions 150–200ms; `active:scale-[0.98]` on primary buttons only. Hover shifts color/border, never position.
- **Voice.** Sentence case, no hype, precise numbers. AI answers open with "Based on *<source>*, …" and every answer shows source chips.

**When building new UI**, lift patterns from `.claude/skills/moca-library-design/preview/*.html` (23 component specimens) or `.claude/skills/moca-library-design/ui_kits/library/*.jsx` (Shell, ManageScreen, ExploreScreen, AskScreen). Match the visual output — you don't need to copy the prototype's internal structure.

## Configuration

All config is read from the container environment — there is no admin UI and no
database. See `.env.example`.

- **Cortex:** `CORTEX_API_URL` + `CORTEX_API_KEY` (single read-only key). Deprecated
  aliases `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `LIBRARY_API_URL` are mirrored onto `CORTEX_API_URL`
  at boot in `src/instrumentation.ts` with a console warning.
- **Branding/analytics (optional, with defaults in `src/lib/settings.ts`):** `APP_TITLE`,
  `APP_DESCRIPTION`, `ACCENT_COLOR`, `LOCALE` (`en`/`de`), `LOGO_URL`, `SUPPORT_URL`,
  `SUPPORT_LABEL`, `CORTEX_ANALYTICS_TEMPLATE`. Surfaced to the client via `/api/config`.
- **Site:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (compile-time, SEO/OpenGraph).
- Server-side config must never be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` — it stays on the
  server. The app boots even with no `CORTEX_API_KEY` (Library disabled, galleries fine).

## Conventions

- Hex color values must be quoted in `.env` files (e.g. `"#ff9500"`) because `#` is treated as a comment by dotenv
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars are compile-time inlined by Next.js — runtime config uses the `/api/config` endpoint instead
- German UI uses du-form; keep product terms (Deep Research, etc.) in English even in German locale
- Route handlers validate input with `zod`. There are no auth gates — every Library route is public.
- Static editorial content lives in `src/content/*.json` (writings, timeline, incubator, manifesto, press-room, moca-live), rendered by Server Components + a client browser component. The **MOCA Live** (`/moca-live`) streams and **Press Room → Artist Interviews** lists are scraped from YouTube and refreshed with `node scripts/scrape-youtube.mjs` — see `scripts/README.md`.
