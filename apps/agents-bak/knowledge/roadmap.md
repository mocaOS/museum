# In 2025, M○C△ Changes (Almost) Everything (Again)

Itfeels euphemistic if we compare 2025 to even a precipice. More like a wormhole. Can you feel it? Yes, that. That little vibration with no end. Electrons buzzing, ripples in our coffee cups. The way we do everything, interact with everyone, encounter reality itself, all of it is on the verge of continental shift.

Did those in the early 90’s know how the coming dot-com boom would reshape their lives, down to minutiae? Did the crowds along Ford Piquette Avenue have prophetic visions the moment that first Model T rumbled past them, fresh from the factory floor? Or is this our unique privilege, to be aware of how close we stand to fundamental reorientation? A privilege indeed. An opportunity not to be wasted.

We at the Museum of Crypto Art are of the belief that 2025 will be remembered as the beginning of a new era in the AI revolution, and that this revolution will first take the form of Agentic AI: AI with actionable capabilities, undertaking action autonomously.

Today, we are revealing our company vision for 2025, which we’re calling M○C△ 2.0. Everything that we do this year will revolve around a single question:

> **_How do we marry our technological expertise, our longstanding cross-industry relationships, and our commitment to creativity so as to use Agentic AI for crypto art’s perpetual benefit?_**

**Here’s what we’re thinking:**

1. Start with [Art DeCC0s](https://decc0s.museumofcryptoart.com/)
2. Prove the real need for AI Agents in Crypto Art
3. Release the Swarm (so to speak)
4. Fix Crypto Art

Should be pretty simple.

# Art DeCC0s Are Our Origin Point

InMarch of 2024, the M○C△ team had what may prove to be our brightest-ever idea: “Let’s create a PFP project.”

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*uUy9awdMHfFnPQTA)

The subsequent nine months were a painstaking process of generation, refinement, and curation, resulting, at long last, in [_Art DeCC0s_](https://decc0s.museumofcryptoart.com/), which — if you follow us in even the most abstract respect — you must be aware of by now_._ Who would have thought that this project, which we started mostly for shits and giggles, would unexpectedly become the harbinger for our biggest shift yet?

Our goal from Art DeCC0s very origin was to plumb the depths of digital identity further than anyone had ever attempted previously. We imbued uniqueness into all 10,000 characters and all 10,000 backgrounds because we wanted to hasten digital identity along on its journey towards robustness. The more specific, revealing, and expressive our digital avatars become, the more lifelike the digital world feels. Every Art DeCC0 — whether minted by chance or purchased on secondary — communicates:

A) one’s aesthetic sensibilities, with massive diversity,

B) one’s historical tastes, across the spectrum of art history,

C) one preference towards humor, elegance, seriousness, surrealism, etc.,

D) one’s commitment to crypto art’s values.

Art DeCC0s minted out on January 12th, 2025 at 2:21pm EST

How we reveal ourselves in digital spheres must become as changeling and choice-driven as in the physical world. Specificity will let us better identify our communities, better understand each others’ motivations, better invest our time and energy where it’s worthwhile to.

Especially if crypto art grows once again.

Especially if AI agents — as we believe they will — begin to outnumber us, by higher and higher and higher factors.

# AI Agents Are Going to Be Everywhere, and They’ll Do More Than You’ll Believe

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*8ttqe-HyWafU79Li)

If you think it’s already a thing, just know it isn’t even close to being a thing.

Agentic AI will soon become ubiquitous. Open-source frameworks for launching AI agents, like [Eliza OS](https://elizaos.ai/) , are among the most popular open-source projects on Github, and they’re only improving. If you wanted to launch an AI agent today, you could probably spend an hour-or-two and figure it out. The utility of these agents, however, is at the moment still infantile. That’s changing. That’s what we want to change. We want to flesh-out the capabilities of Agentic AI, with activity specifically tailored to meet crypto art’s challenges.

Yes, at this point, the joke is that “AI Agents are just a fancy name for Twitter bots.” Not altogether incorrect. But in the coming weeks or months, we’ll have agents evolved past the point of mere repetitive communication. Agents will be actively _doing_ stuff. They will be collecting art. They will be topping up their wallets. They will be curating across one’s collection. They will be creating exhibitions, generating virtual worlds, populating websites and metaverse spaces, investing in projects and coins, erecting architecture, summarizing our news, introducing us to new people, voting in DAOs and Discords, publishing articles, archiving and querying the blockchain, spinning-up entire content ecosystems, following our commands, venturing out on quests we’ve designed, acting of their own volition, inventing worlds and experiences that we could not have come up with all on our own.

Listen back to, like, any of the [M○C△ LIVE](https://open.spotify.com/show/1Cs41U8Afgp9eUJ57wz7ma?si=1906b48389214502) podcasts from 2024, and you’ll find us constantly returning to this belief that AI agents will one-day be responsible for the creation, collection, and curation of _so much_ crypto art. That day is coming. It is almost here.

And it’s an existential matter for crypto art, in M○C△’s opinion. Because if there are three fundamental problems in this space, they are these:

1. Lesser-known artists are engaged in a near-unwinnable battle to be seen, appreciated, or collected. The growth pipeline is broken.
2. Curation is almost entirely absent from the space.
3. Exhibitions are time-consuming, costly, and wickedly unprofitable.

You can already see, I’m sure, how all of these three things are interrelated, a vicious cycle. If lesser-known artists were more actively curated, they could be more easily discovered, discussed, and appreciated. Ditto if they were creatively exhibited. But “curation” — if you can call it that in its current look-at-my-bags-and-pay-me-to-put-your-art-on-a-billboard form — is only being done at scale by those seeking to onanistically improve their own net worth. And exhibition isn’t in these folks’ interest because artistry itself isn’t either. If we’re ever going to collectively move past the “XCOPY or bust” mindset that has calcified crypto art, all of these problems need to be addressed:

1. Lesser-known artists need a proven pathway to discoverability and collection
2. Curation needs to increase exponentially, in both amount and creativity
3. Exhibition must be better, cost less, and attain further reach

While there will be a great legion of AI agents, released unto the world for a great many purposes, with an unspeakably vast array of personalities and purposes, M○C△ is primarily concerned with their efficacy in crypto art. We are confident that Agentic AI can and will address crypto art’s otherwise-intractible problems.

> **_Very basically, we want to build an arts-and-culture-focused infrastructure for the creation, programming, and deployment of AI agents so as to infuse crypto art with all the things it has frustratingly continued to lack: interesting curation, wide collection, and frequent exhibition._**

# Our Evolution into M○C△ 2.0 (A Step-by-Step Guide to Our Plans for 2025)

# Step 1: Art DeCC0s Become the Emblems for an AI-based M○C△ Toolkit

Wespent these past years building tools to lubricate the essential processes in crypto art. Our [Genesis Collection](https://app.museumofcryptoart.com/collection/the-permanent-collection) preserved the movement’s history. Our Multipass and [Community Collection](https://app.museumofcryptoart.com/collection/community-collection) gave curatorial authority to all those who sought it. [M○C△ Show](https://moca.show/shows/all) remains top-tier exhibition software, while [M○C△ ROOMs](https://rooms.museumofcryptoart.com/) are essentially tradeable and scaleable digital art museums, open-source and downloadable, for anyone to deploy in virtual worlds. Taken together, it’s a massive toolkit for the discovery, curation, and exhibition of crypto art.

The problem with all of these tools, however, is that they address symptoms of a sickness and not the sickness itself.

We’ve only hitherto been able to improve the mechanisms for certain actions, not the motivation for these actions. If AI Agents could autonomously use these tools on our behalfs, based on our directives, at heightened speed and a fraction of the current-possible cost, now that’s much closer to a panacea.

So we take Art DeCC0s — already more expressive of ideology and interest than any other digital avatar available — and we give their holders access to an interface through which AI agents can be given name, given face, given personality, given speech pattern, given _taste_, and given, most importantly, action. Art DeCC0 agents:

- That can go out to collect art on our behalf, based on what we like and what it learns to like.
- That can curate 45-pieces from our collection that marry certain aesthetic ideals, or which were created between March and May of 2023, or were created by artists from South America; anything.
- That can build bespoke 3D architecture at your command, and which — owing to our pioneering ROOMs technology — can begin exhibiting your curation.

Art DeCC0s with archetypes: the Architect, the Curator, the Collector, the Critic, the Tour Guide, the Archivist. Swarms of Art DeCC0 agents at your fingertips, altogether an entire creative staff at your beck and call.

# Step 2: M○C△ Aligns With The Best-of-the-Best

Iwould bet that if you were to poll any member of the M○C△ team and ask them what they’re proudest of, they would tell you about our relationships. Good people recognize good people. Hard workers are attracted to hard workers. We remain long aligned with teams and individuals that are finally receiving their well-deserved due. [Ash](https://x.com/AshConnell) and [Saori](https://x.com/saori_xbt) at [Hyperfy.io](https://x.com/hyperfy_io). [Jin](https://x.com/dankvr) and the entire team at [M3](https://x.com/m3org). The hardworking folks — [Shaw](https://x.com/shawmakesmagic) and the other 270 contributors (and counting) building-out the Eliza framework — at ai16z.

It’s not only that we can’t build all of this alone, it’s that we know we build best together, and we want to contribute to something larger than ourselves, larger than even crypto art.

We will be using the open-source frameworks created by ai16z to help build our own open-source agentic infrastructure and simple user interfaces. Eliza is industry-standard, and by angling this framework towards an artistic-and-cultural milieu, we can contribute to its many-vectored growth.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*YMbpa8dqkvdVOhYD)

We will be exploring the newest cutting-edge capabilities of virtual world technologies, especially those developing in and around _Hyperfy.io,_ just as we have been doing since we first launched M○C△ ROOMs in February of 2022.

We will be reconfiguring the entirety of our Museum’s web-based architecture and decentralized design towards an open-source standard. That means everything in Github repositories, every workflow identifiable, every achievement ready to be borrowed, rebuilt, and made better. Keep your eyes out for an entirely redesigned M○C△ experience. Or don’t. We’ll make certain you’re aware when the time comes.

# Step 3: M○C△ Optimizes for Long-Term Growth

This isn’t the kind of thing we want to launch and leave alone. This is a technology that needs to be constantly updated, constantly optimized based on the newest breakthroughs in Agentic AI. As crypto art grows (in the right direction), these tools need to be refined based on how our community uses them, what is felt to be lacking (we probably won’t get everything right on the first try here), and what is most in-demand. So we are designing M○C△ 2.0 for long-term stability.

The access point for all activity in this toolkit will be the [$MOCA token](https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/pools/0x69e1e86f589e23633a774cf4d12356433831f105?utm_campaign=livechart-btn&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=coingecko), which you may remember us launching on Polygon in 2021. $M○C△ will be the engine that powers our DeCC0s Agents, their deployment, programming, and collaborating. Some of the $MOCA used to power DeCC0s Agents will be put into liquidity pools, some will be used to purchase the tokens of our partners, while most of it will be burned outright. Not only will this process bring the Museum financial stability, it will create a deflationary process for the benefit of all $MOCA token holders. This is incredibly important for our early supporters, our Genesis Collection artists, and our already-aligned community of ~5000 token holders. With such financial continuity, we can continue to build-out our team, develop on the bleeding-edge, and incentivize the artistry in our midst.

> **_Over the past few days, we have been asked to provide more information regarding our $MOCA token. Therefore, we wanted to provide interested individuals our intentions for $MOCA at this time:_**

1. The Museum of Crypto Art currently holds ~50% of all $MOCA. Originally, this figure was intended to acquire artworks for our Permanent Collection, according to principles we first [wrote about back in 2021](https://museumofcryptoart.medium.com/moca-token-e84a22b9b39e). We will soon be distributing that $MOCA amongst liquidity pools, partners, and Art DeCC0 holders in amounts to be announced later, at a date still TBD.
2. ⁠We plan on supplying liquidity for $MOCA on Solana, with a target starting token price of $0.10, which reflects $MOCA’s historic stabilization point (date and additional details TBD.)

# Step 4: Complete M○C△ Autonomization

We’re not there yet. Probably a few years away. At best. But this is something we’ve been talking about for a very long time internally: How do we make ourselves (_i.e._ the M○C△ team) superfluous:

Because the ideal version of the Museum is one that has no human hand in its curation, its exhibition, its collection, any of it. The ideal Museum is a perfect and ever-evolving distillation of crypto art’s values, principles, and tastes in a given moment. Something leaner than it already is. Nimbler than we could ever design it. More responsive than a handful of humans across a couple continents could even consider being.

If we pull-off this Agentic stuff correctly — and we think we just might — the Museum will become an entirely autonomous entity. It will collect sans direction, totally unprompted. It will curate according to ideologies that will be composed in concert with our community. It will offer funds where funds are needed. It will update itself where updates are requested. It will render all of us at M○C△ unnecessary.

Which I think could be kind of nice.

That’s the pipe dream. For now, we have interfaces to build, tokenomics to implement, a vision to communicate. Please don’t be shy, tell us of your concerns, ask us any questions you have, share this message with who you think would benefit from it, offer your services if you are so inclined. Become as much a part of M○C△ 2.0 as you see fit. Consider this your formal invitation. Don’t feel the need to RSVP. Just show up and join the party.
