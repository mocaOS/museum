**Our mission is to preserve the truth.** A common truth is found when many voices are heard.

At its core, the Museum of Crypto Art (MOCA) challenges, creates conflict, provokes. MOCA puts forward a broad representation of perspectives meant to upend our sense of who we are. It poses two questions: _“what is art?” and “who decides?”_

We aim to resolve these questions through a multi-stakeholder decentralized platform of art curation and exhibition.

What follows is the MOCA mission.

MOCA is a testament to those who dared to believe in a better future that prioritized sovereignty, market access, and freedom of expression in the arts. Crypto art is a visual aesthetic that communicates these ideals. Those who rise to the challenge of creating crypto art are evangelists for a new socio-economic paradigm. MOCA takes collective actions to form a revolution.

As the first cultural institution of crypto art, MOCA will become the premier space for discourse around digital art, crypto culture, frontier technology, and the NFT revolution. It will be an experimental playground for reawakening imagination. It will be free-form, refuse stasis, and seek inspiration and leadership from an inclusive and global community.

The MOCA _Genesis Collection_ is a time capsule for the Metaverse and its travelers. The artworks which comprise the _Genesis Collection_ represent the earliest etchings on the blockchain, and will come to be regarded as the digital cave paintings of our transhumanist narrative. There is a uniquely human, ineffable “why?” which future algorithms will attempt to interpret when they analyze these initial blockchain transactions. We anticipate the collection will be critical in answering this question.

The Museum has developed the infrastructure to align interests and safeguard the communal story of crypto art. At the heart of this is the public good and its stewardship. Introducing **$MOCA** incentivizes collaboration and allows people to add to and responsibly care for a community collection. In tying relationships, investments, and interests together, we create resilience and multiple access points for all members.

MOCA will offer a multitude of experiences around artwork and artists. This will create deeper layers of social, physical, and digital connections and realities. In making the Museum more accessible and shareable, crypto art will permeate everyday experience.

Our curation systems and interactive social layers will aim to connect artists and collectors to create long-term symbiotic relationships. These new dynamics will transform the way digital art collections are grown and shared. We will reject outside determinations, and cement a cohesive structure that can shape our communal identity, culture, and recognize what is foundational.

Our space awakens you in a way that invites personal change, and reminds you that change is inevitable. MOCA welcomes the public to explore the beautiful and soul-quenching need to create and recreate.
