# The MOCA Tech Stack

At the Museum of Crypto Art (MOCA), we‚Äôve reimagined what it means to be a Museum, bringing immersive art exhibitions, free tooling and software, high-level scholarship, and an engaging community atmosphere to a purely-online museum. MOCA is an industry leader in adapting new technologies ‚Äîmetaverse, blockchain, and AI‚Äî for practical application in a cultural institution.

We, however, envision a broader future, in which¬†*any*¬†cultural institution can deploy its own AI-powered museum. Therein, visitors can interact with curated and immersive exhibits alongside one another and alongside personalized AI agents, acting as curators and tour guides, each personalized to fit a given institution‚Äôs vibe.

Welcome to our open-source museum tech stack, and the unprecedented possibilities it presents for cultural institutions forever.

Our mission, put simply: Provide a fully-deployable museum codebase where any enthusiast, collector, or cultural body can summon a top-tier curatorial, exhibitive, architectural, and artistic museum experience with ease. We‚Äôre not just sharing software; we‚Äôre democratizing access to a new paradigm in art experience.

## The Code Base

We began working on this particular code base in early 2025 and already shipped an MVP that ties our Art Collections and Library into a unified stack. As we continue to build new features, we continue the process of migrating legacy code into our new codebase.

This codebase is designed to enable any museum to deploy our tech for themselves. Meanwhile, MOCA as an organization is able to facilitate functionalities (which) are closely tied to $MOCA tokenomics) into their own deployment of this tech stack.

Here is a sample of what we‚Äôre offering thus far:

1. **Art Collections**: Import and organize your artworks or NFTs into the backend and categorize them into collections. Your configured art is displayed in the frontend, as the APIs serve metadata + media, i.e. images, videos, 3D models.

2. **The Library**: An AI retrieval system for all documents‚Äîor an agentic search-engine for your content. Built around¬†[R2R](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R), it enables entity-based knowledge graphs for high-end data extraction. The Library plugs into a backend via SDK so that uploaded documents are automatically aggregated to the Library UX.

3. **MOCA ROOMs**: Originally launched in 2022, this¬†[modular architecture](https://hackmd.io/@reneil1337/moca)¬†enables the exhibition and transportation of entire art exhibitions across immersive worlds. Upon deployment, all CC0 MOCA ROOMs are automatically populated into your museum instance, setting the baseline for your interoperable museum architecture.
   
   - WIP: Building out¬†[Hyperfy](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy)¬†Integration with aims to enable a user-friendly way to manage ROOMs‚Äîe.g. positioning and scaling NFT-display slots in a way that exhibitions can be manipulated hassle-free, as well as a novel storage-mix that combines museum backends and .hyp files to enable retrieval of all ROOM configurations into any given world.

4. **Art DeCC0s**: Art Decc0s are 10,000 uniquely generated¬†[CC0 PFPs](https://opensea.io/collection/art-decc0s), and the future face of agentic capabilities which will be woven throughout the software stack. Fueled by¬†[ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza), these unique personas bridge a given museum into social media, chat applications, and virtual worlds. They are enabled with all knowledge from your Library.
   
   - WIP: Building the MOCA Plugin for ElizaOS and allowing Art Decc0 holders to launch agents which are pre-configured according to unique, generated personas.
   
   - TBD: Integrating into MOCA ROOMs via¬†[Eliza3D](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-3d-hyperfy-starter), enabling DeCC0s to spawn in Hyperfy as interactive NPCs.

Regarding Intelligence: We highly recommend fueling Library and agents via¬†[comput3](https://comput3.ai/). Our own deployment uses Hermes3:70b by¬†[Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/), and we love it. Holders of DeCC0 NFTs don‚Äôt need to worry about this, as the official MOCA deployment enables them with free Hermes3 intelligence out-of-the-box.

### Deploy Your Own Museum

Our technical documentation is still under construction. Like a grand gallery being prepped for its opening night, we‚Äôre a work in progress. As we implement and refine the features outlined in this repo (from AI-driven ROOMs to DeCC0 agents and The Library), we‚Äôll be continuously improving the docs to make every subsection clearer, more comprehensive, and easier to deploy for institutions and individuals alike.

This is a collaborative experiment, and we‚Äôre building the scaffolding in public. If you‚Äôre eager to dive deeper, contribute, or deploy your own museum stack,¬†[hop into our Discord](https://discord.gg/Rs7wxUTrWV)‚Äîwe‚Äôll guide you through the maze while we write the map.
